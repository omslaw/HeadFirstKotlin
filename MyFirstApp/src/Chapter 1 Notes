Exercises

1. Infinite loop
x not being incremented with x = x + 1

2. cant run as variable is using val instead of var since its being
incremented
printing on same line but using print and no variable to output
so use $x and space

var x = 10
 while ( x > 1) {
     x = x - 1
     if (x < 3) println("small $x ")
 }

3. will all print on same line. no variables and no else so wont
compile

var x = 10
 while (x > 1) {
     x = x - 1
     print(if (x < 3) "small $x " else " big $x ")
 }

got mixed messages all correct
got code magnets correct as well
