Be the compiler exercises

1. I don't see anything wrong with it

fun doSomething(msg: String, i: Int): Unit {
if (i > 0) {
var x = 0
while (x < i) {
println(msg)
x = x + 1
}
}
}

ANSWER: page 155 and my answer correct

2. you can't modify the passed in variable. should be a new
variable created and then have the *3 and return the new variable

fun timesThree(x: Int): Int {
x = x * 3
return x
}

Answer: page 155. my answer mostly correct, but when you create new variable
the *3 return value might end up being bigger than an int so has to be considered


3. No return type listed.. should be int return .. do you need to handle 0 or
negative numbers? should while loop be <= instead? is array skipping 0 in the array?


fun maxValue(args: Array<Int>) {
var max = args[0]
var x = 1
while (x < args.size) {
var item = args[x]
max = if (max >= item) max else item
x = x + 1
}
return max
}

Answer: page 155 - my answer is correct, wont compile because function needs to declare
it returns an int... the rest of my answer was moot i suppose since question was whether
it will compile or not.

Good note to remember:

While loops run while a given condition is true.
For loops run over a range of values or items.
